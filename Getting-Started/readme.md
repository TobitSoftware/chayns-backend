### Getting Started

These projects are supposed to give you a first insight on how the chayns® Backend API works.<br>
They are currently available in C# and NodeJS.

These projects require basic knowledge about the Backend API. If you haven't done yet, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/TobitSoftware/chayns-backend/wiki).

The first sample is about how to get information to the location the developer tapp is installed on.<br>
It is dedicated as a showcase on how the chayns® Backend API can be accessed.

The second sample will show you, how to create a PageAccessToken and send it to the client.<br>
This should help you, if you prefer to perform client-side requests to the Backend API.

For more information take a look at the project folders.
